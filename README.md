<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src = "Images\heroimage.jpg" alt = "Hero-Image">

The homework is design to explore methods to present data by using HTML, bootstrap, and CSS.

* The Dataset that was used to generate the visualizations for this projects are from the weather date from cities that were collected before. 

* We are going to be constructing 7 different pages
1. homepage - index.html
2. comparison page - comparison.html
3. data page - data.html
4. max-temperature visualization page - temp_visual.html
5. cloudiness visualization page - cloudiness_visual.html
6. windspeed visualization page - wind_visual.html
7. humidity visualization page - humidity_visual.html

  

## Using Bootstrap and creating the homepage

The first focus was to create the homepage and it is separated into two primary categories:

1. The description and purpose of the project.
2. The visualizations.

### Purpose of Project.

To layout this section, we would need to have the image and the verbiage.

Next we will copy the dedicated csv from our directories.
